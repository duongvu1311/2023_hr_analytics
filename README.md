# HR Analytics | 2nd Personal Project

## INTRODUCTION

In this 2nd analytics project, I use RStudio to explore HR dataset and aim to answer these following business questions:

1. DE&I metrics: Do we have any Gender or Race salary gap?
2. Pay compression: Are new hires paid higher than current employees? Can we predict salary based on education and other demographical factors?
3. Analysing employee attrition: What do resignees look like? Why did they leave? Can we predict their tenure length?
4. Attrition probabilities: By using random forest, how accurate can we predict whether a particular employee leaves or stays?
